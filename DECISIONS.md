The following list decisions made that aren't directly listed as part of the exercise.

## Historical Analysis API
1. Added navigation menu to the home page to handle routing to new additions
2. Only included deals in closed won or closed lost status because we are focused on deals that have closed already.
3. Targeted expected_close_date for the date filtering based on the assumption it holds our closed date for closed deals.
4. Update the input text contrast globally as much for me because it was tough to see by default.
